This is a repository containing all the kinds of coding that Jennifer Lam has done.

## Personal:
- **Discord bot (Python through Repl.it server, hosted through Cybrancee):** Kokorose Barista (2025)
> Kokorose Barista handles tasks for an cafe-thened discord server for artists and helps with tasks such as assigning server member notification related roles when prompted as well as keeping track of the server's most loved artworks to display at the end of the week and at the end of each month.
- **Discord bot (Python through Repl.it server, hosted through Cybrancee):** Pumpkino (2025)
> With an alias as the server's most beloved cat, the discord bot serves as a role assignment bot that ensures the best security for the server and easy server management
- **Discord bot (Python):** PIU bot (2024)
> Pump It Up (PIU) is a popular arcade dance game that was created in Korea but well-played across the world. ALthough the game itself has an online feature where you can view your own personal game statistics, there isn't a easy available method to view the statistics of other players, including your friends. The PIU bot uses the API from [PIU Tracker](https://piutracker.app/) in order to integrate shared game statistics onto a frequently used social app (Discord!). Through this, players can easily check their shared scores without needing to check the website while seamlessly conversing with their friends.
- **Discord bot (Python through Repl.it server, co-creator with [Tung Dao Seckar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dao-seckar/)):** Aishi (2019)
> Aishi is a convenient discord bot that allows players of popular games such as Granblue Fantasy and League of Legends to have a better multi-player experience, allowing players to get access to game codes as well as player stats within the comfort of discord. As discord is a main form of communication most commonly used amongst gamers, it permits players of these popular games to have access to stats and other information conveniently where they chat amongst their fellow community members.

### Wustholz Lab 2019-2022:
- **SERS Data Analysis Program 2019-2020**
> For many years, spectrometry graphs collected through Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) has always been manually analyzed to determine the matching pigments per historical paint sample. As it is quite a time-consuming task, I took it upon as a challenge to see if it was possible to make it easier to differentiate the different chemicals through the use of machine learning, and additionally make it easier to train new scientists in the lab. A prototype was created with an initial sample set of 200 spectrometry graphs of pigments as well as a set of 1100+ Raman spectra from an open database APIP to test protype model performance. With implementation of quality control stands, data augmentation, and about 850+ sample graphs, an accruacy of 95% was reached to differentiate between various paint pigments.
- **SMS Machine Learning Program 2021-2022**
> With the success of the SERS project, the Single Molecule Spectrometry (SMS) Machine Learning Program was founded to perform a similar task to the SERS Data Analysis Program but with different spectrometry graphs. Although I was not in the lab to see the end of the project, I helped build the foundations for the project that is now currently ongoing in the Wustholz Lab thereafter.
