## Personal:
- **Discord bot (Python through Repl.it server, hosted through Cybrancee):** Kokorose Barista (2025)
> Kokorose Barista handles tasks for an cafe-thened discord server for artists and helps with tasks such as assigning server member notification related roles when prompted as well as keeping track of the server's most loved artworks to display at the end of the week and at the end of each month.
- **Discord bot (Python through Repl.it server, hosted through Cybrancee):** Pumpkino (2025)
> With an alias as the server's most beloved cat, the discord bot serves as a role assignment bot that ensures the best security for the server and easy server management
- **Discord bot (Python):** PIU bot (2024)
> Pump It Up (PIU) is a popular arcade dance game that was created in Korea but well-played across the world. ALthough the game itself has an online feature where you can view your own personal game statistics, there isn't a easy available method to view the statistics of other players, including your friends. The PIU bot uses the API from [PIU Tracker](https://piutracker.app/) in order to integrate shared game statistics onto a frequently used social app (Discord!). Through this, players can easily check their shared scores without needing to check the website while seamlessly conversing with their friends.
- **Discord bot (Python through Repl.it server, co-creator with [Tung Dao Seckar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dao-seckar/)):** Aishi (2019)
> Aishi is a convenient discord bot that allows players of popular games such as Granblue Fantasy and League of Legends to have a better multi-player experience, allowing players to get access to game codes as well as player stats within the comfort of discord. As discord is a main form of communication most commonly used amongst gamers, it permits players of these popular games to have access to stats and other information conveniently where they chat amongst their fellow community members.
